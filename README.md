# Exchange Rate API

The Exchange Rate API is an API developed using the Spring Boot framework in Java, with the aim of allowing users to fetch exchange rates between a vast set of supported currencies, as well as allowing them to do value conversions between these currencies, using said exchange rates. The exchange rate data is fetched from a publically available API, [exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/#/), which sources the rates from the European Comission's databases. 

This project was developed using the feature-branch workflow, and various QA techniques to ensure the service met the specified requirements, such as the development of a CI pipeline using Sonar Cloud for static code analysis and running unit and integration tests. 
A cache was also integrated to ease the required calls made to the external provider.
